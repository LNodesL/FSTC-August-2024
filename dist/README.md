# FSTC Distributables

A demo program (FSTC.exe) that downloads the encrypted PE (hello world program: Payload.exe) from this repo's resources/ folder (using commit hash URL for 100% safety verification on the demo program). Payload.exe in the dist/ folder is not encrypted. It gets encrypted from Build.exe, then you upload it, then you compile your FSTC program with the new URL and key/iv data.
